# 👋 Hi, I'm Kang

**Solution Architect / Senior Fullstack Engineer**

I focus on designing **scalable, reliable backend systems** under real-world constraints.
My work emphasizes **system design, architectural trade-offs, and predictable delivery** rather than demos or buzzwords.

---

## 🧭 Professional Focus

- System design for production environments
- Backend-heavy architecture with clear boundaries
- Distributed systems and asynchronous processing
- Reliability, stability, and operational simplicity
- CI/CD, deployment strategies, and failure handling

I value **clarity, responsibility, and long-term maintainability** in both code and architecture.

## 🏗️ Areas of Expertise

- **Architecture**
  - System design & decomposition
  - Architectural decision-making (trade-offs, constraints)
  - Failure scenarios & bottleneck analysis

- **Backend & Infrastructure**
  - AWS Cloud (ECS, SQS, RDS, EventBridge)
  - Job/queue-based execution models
  - Concurrency control & resource limiting
  - CI/CD pipelines, rollback strategies

- **Engineering Practice**
  - Clean handover documentation
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
  - Pragmatic monitoring & operational checklists

---

## 📂 What You'll Find Here

Pinned repositories typically include:
- System design case studies
- Architecture notes and diagrams
- ADR-style decision documentation
- Practical backend or infra-focused implementations

Code is not always the main artifact — **decisions and reasoning are**.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

- Prefer **simple, understandable systems** over clever ones
- Make trade-offs explicit
- Optimize for **stability before throughput**
- Documentation is part of delivery, not an afterthought

## 📄 CV & Contact

- CV: Available upon request or via external link
- GitHub is used primarily for **technical substance**, not presentation
